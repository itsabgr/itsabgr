I started programming at 16 by learning Lua in a self-study manner.
I am known as an eager researcher and enjoy studying, designing, and building systems, especially network-based ones.
I have the knowledge of low-level network programming on Linux, for this Ubuntu is my OS.
I built 15+ projects, some within a team but mostly on my own as a software engineer and a backend developer.


## NOTABLE PROJECTS

### Ride-sharing app
An Online-taxi project was done by NodeJS+TypeScript.
MongoDB was my main database mainly because of its geo-special and schema-less capabilities and GridFS.
I also used MySQL for financial transactions.
There was no use of WebSockets for notifications and instead I used a queue and HTTP polling method for those cases.
Its architecture was also used for a massage reservation app and e-commerce, but GRPC was replaced by REST.


### Asset management app
An Asset management system was made by NodeJS for a province that needed to manage and record the repair history of its pylons and wires between them.
There were a lot of 4K images that are being stored in GridFS and due to complex relationships and queries, MySQL was used as the main Database.


### Course management system
An Educational course management system for a university was developed by NodeJS.
MongoDB was used for their main database and the challenge was that some complicated time-overlaps and conflicts had to be managed.


### Live Video Streaming
A lives streaming service in Go with CDN capabilities was developed for an online classroom system.


### Decentralized Messenger
A federated and decentralized end-to-end encrypted messenger by Go in a very simple but fast and secure architecture inspired by email was developed.
A DHT was developed for its peer discovery to store users' information into that, like what IPNS does, and also a special blockchain was made in order to register and assign unique names to users.
Moreover, a DNS proxy and resolver was crafted so as to integrate into current networks.
Finally a cross-platform client library was made in Dart.
