I started programming at 16 by learning Lua in a self-study manner.
I am known as an eager researcher and enjoy studying, designing, and building systems, especially network-based ones.
I have good knowledge of low-level network programming on Linux, so Ubuntu is my OS.
I built 15+ projects, some within a team but mostly of them on my own as a software engineer and a backend developer.


## NOTABLE PROJECTS

### Ride-sharing app
Online-taxi project by NodeJS+TypeScript.
MongoDB was my main database mainly because of its geo-special and schema-less capabilities and GridFS.
I also used MySQL for financial transactions.
There was no use of WebSockets for notifications and instead I used a queue and HTTP polling method for those cases.
Its architecture was also used for a massage reservation app and e-commerce but GRPC was replaced by REST.


### Asset management app
Asset management system was made by NodeJS for a province that needs to manage and record the repair history of its pylons and wires between then.
there were a lot of 4K images that I stored in GridFS and cause of complex relationships and queries I used MySQL for their main Database.


### Course management system
Educational course management system for a university by NodeJS.
I used MongoDB for their main database and some complicated time-overlaps and conflicts should be managed.


### Live Video Streaming
Live Streaming service for an online classroom system by developing an HTTP-lives-streaming service in Go with CDN capabilities.


### Decentralized Messenger
A federated and decentralized end-to-end encrypted messenger by Go in a very simple but fast and secure architecture inspired by email.
I developed a DHT for its peer discovery to store users' information into that like what IPNS does and a special blockchain to register and assign unique names to users. I also developed a DNS proxy and resolver for integration and a cross-platform client library in Dart.
