I started programming at 16 by learning Lua in a self-study manner.
I am known as an eager researcher and enjoy studying, designing, and building systems, especially network-based ones.
I have knowledge of low-level network programming on Linux, and for this Ubuntu is my OS.
I built 15+ projects, some within a team but mostly on my own as a software engineer and a backend developer.


## NOTABLE PROJECTS

### Ride-sharing App
An Online-taxi project was done by NodeJS+TypeScript.
MongoDB was my main database mainly because of its geo-special and schema-less capabilities and GridFS.
I also used MySQL for financial transactions.
There was no use of WebSockets for notifications and instead I used a queue and HTTP polling method for those cases.
Its architecture was also used for a massage reservation app and e-commerce, but GRPC was replaced by REST.


### Asset Management App
An Asset management system was made by NodeJS for a province that needed to manage and record the repair history of its pylons and wires between them.
There were a lot of 4K images that are being stored in GridFS and due to complex relationships and queries, MySQL was used as the main Database.


### Course Management System
An Educational course management system for a university was developed by NodeJS.
MongoDB was used for their main database and the challenge was that some complicated time overlaps and conflicts had to be managed.


### Live Streaming
A scalable live-streaming service in Go with CDN capabilities was developed for an online classroom system.


### Decentralized Messenger
A federated and decentralized end-to-end encrypted messenger by Go in a very simple but fast and secure architecture inspired by email was developed.
A DHT was developed for its peer discovery to store users' information into that, like what IPNS does, and also a special blockchain was made in order to register and assign unique names to users.
Moreover, a DNS proxy and resolver was crafted to integrate into current networks.
Finally, a cross-platform client library was made in Dart.

### Decentralized Cryptocurrency

A Decentralized DAG-based cryptocurrency that leverage the best Ideas from other projects.
I also developed an interpreted scripting language due to implementing human-readble smart contracts.
It can process transactions near a second with low cost and
It's built-in to create new tokens with their parallel and separate chains.

### Ethereum-compatible blockchain

A sequential PoS Ethereum-compatible chain
on top of the Tendermint / Cosmos SDK with some optimizations.
I understood how Ethereum and EVM work in depths to make it Ethereum-compatible and expose the same API as Ethereum.
To improve the throughput I added some optimizations in the processing and consensus parts.
I also used a method to solve blockchain big data size problem.
