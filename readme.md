I started programming at 16 by learning Lua in a self-study manner.
Iâ€™m known as an eager researcher and enjoy studying, designing, and building systems especially network-based ones.
I have good knowledge of low-level network programming on Linux, so Ubuntu is my OS.
I built 15+ projects some in a team but more of them lonely as a software engineer and backend developer.


### Projects
- - - -
## Ride-sharing app
Online-taxi project by **NodeJS**+**TypeScript**.
**MongoDB** was my main database cause of its geo-special and schema-less capabilities and GridFS.
I also used **MySQL** for financial transactions.
there was no use of WebSockets for notifications and I used a queue and HTTP polling method for that cases.
its architecture was also used for a massage reservation app and e-commerce but replaced REST by GRPC and by a microservice architecture using NATS.


## Asset management app
Asset management system by NodeJS for a province that needs to manage and record the repair history of its pylons and wires between them.
there were a lot of 4K images that I stored into GridFS and cause of complex relationships and queries I used MySQL for their main Database.


## Course management system
Educational course management system for a university by NodeJS.
I used MongoDB for their main database and some complicated time-overlaps and conflicts should be managed.


## Live Video Streaming
Live Streaming service for an online classroom system by developing an HTTP-lives-streaming service in Go with CDN capabilities.


## Decentralized Messenger
A federated and decentralized end-to-end encrypted messenger by Go in a very simple but fast and secure architecture inspired by email.
I also developed a DHT for its peer discovery to store users' information into that like what IPNS does and a special blockchain to register and assign unique names to users. I also developed a DNS proxy and resolver for integration.
I developed a cross-platform client library in Dart.
